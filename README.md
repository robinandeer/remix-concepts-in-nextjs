# Remix Concepts in Next.js

This is an exploration in implementing various Remix concepts in Next.js. It uses the official Remix getting started guide as a starting point.

There are two branches in this repo:

- `remix`: the original Remix implementation
- `main`: the "remixed" Next.js implementation

You are currently viewing the Next.js implementation.

## Deployment

You only need to [import your Git repository](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel, and it will be deployed.

If you'd like to avoid using a Git repository, you can also deploy the directory by running [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli):

```sh
yarn global add vercel
vercel
```

It is generally recommended to use a Git repository, because future commits will then automatically be deployed by Vercel, through its [Git Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git).

## Development

To run your Remix app locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed:

```sh
yarn
```

Afterwards, start the Remix development server like so:

```sh
yarn dev
```

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready to go!

If you're used to using the `vercel dev` command provided by [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) instead, you can also use that, but it's not needed.
